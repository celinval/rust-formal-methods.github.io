# Rust Formal Methods Interest Group

[WG repo](https://github.com/rust-formal-methods/wg) | [Zulip Channel](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/183875-wg-formal-methods)

The RFMIG provides a forum for academics, industry users and any other interested party discuss and collaborate on the challenges of Rust program verification.

Our objectives are to:

*Improve communication between formal tool developers and the Rust core teams*
- Hold 'office hours' with Rust team members to answer questions about the `rustc` API or the direction of the language.
- Identify weak points in Rust's current tool interfaces, help shepherd the improvements the formal methods community needs.

*Foster a community of formal methods tools and users*
- Provide a platform for tool developers to share their work and encourage collaboration.
- Gather feedback and input from industrial and hobbyist users of formal method tooling.
- Work towards improving tool inter-compatibility, in particular of specifications.
